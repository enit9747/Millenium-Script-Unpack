# Millenium-Script-Unpack
Millenium is a bad and outdated r6 script, if you are looking for actual scripts, check out antarctica at: http://antarcticacheats.xyz/


Rainbow Six Siege Script being sold for $20. The code is really messy and in general bad. I do not recommend anyone to use this.

To see all cracked versions press the button that says 2.1 above the files.

Millenium is a pasted rainbow six script being sold for up to $40, the owners do not know anything about .net protection and therefore uses
confuserex + themida to protect this shit.

Millennium is spelled correctly with two n's but the owner obviously doesn't understand that.
